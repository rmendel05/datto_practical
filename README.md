Datto Practical from Rob Mendelsohn
Option 1: CSV Load, Sort, Report

To view source in Eclipse, map the workspace to the "source" directory.

To run this solution, execute the Java jar file personViewer contained in the install folder.  You will need to have the Java runtime 1.7 or higher installed.  A copy of the sample input file is included in the install folder.  From the command line, type:

java -jar personViewer --help

to see instructions or

java -jar personViewer <csv file>

to load and execute query operations on the file data.

Future Improvements:
	* Support commas contained in quotes in csv values
	* Support alternate column order using header names to match column values
	* Support more generic column value management in the Person class
	* Improve layout of query results
